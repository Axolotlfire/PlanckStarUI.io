That’s it. No build steps, no complex tooling. Grab what you need and use it however you like.

## 🛠️ Project Requirements

Although this project doesn't need to be installed, there are **three essential tools** you'll need to have in your project to make the components work as expected:

 
### 1. [Astro](https://docs.astro.build)

> The modern framework for building fast, content-driven websites.

Astro is a **static site generator** that lets you use your favorite frontend tools in a highly optimized environment. It delivers lightning-fast performance and a great developer experience.

Install Astro with:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```
Choose a name for your project, select the template you like, and add any dependencies you need.

More details at the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build).

### 2. [TailwindCSS](https://docs.astro.build)

> A utility-first CSS framework for building modern and responsive user interfaces.

Most components in this project are styled using Tailwind CSS. It's fast, flexible, and makes styling your pages a breeze.

<Steps>

1. To install it in your Astro project:
   
   ```bash
   npx astro add tailwind
   ```  

2. Then go to your src/styles/global.css file and import Tailwind. If it doesn't exist, create it — it will be useful, especially if you want to define variables or customize Tailwind configurations:

   ```css
   <!-- src/styles/global.css -->
   @import "tailwindcss";
   ```

3. After setting up your global.css, go to your layout file (e.g. src/layouts/Layout.astro) and import it at the top:

   ```js
   ---
   <!-- src/layouts/Layout.astro -->
   import "../styles/global.css";
   ---
   ```

4. That's it.

</Steps>

[Tailwind + Astro Integration Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#tailwind)

### 3. [ThreeJS](https://docs.astro.build)

> A powerful JavaScript 3D library that brings immersive experiences to the browser.

Some components use Three.js to render particles, 3D animations, and visual effects.

Install it with:

```bash
npm install three
```

Learn more at the [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/).

Once these tools are installed, you're good to go!  
Just copy the components you need into your project and start building
