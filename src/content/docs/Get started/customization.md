description: Learn how to customize styles with Tailwind CSS and visual parameters with Three.js.

Each component in this project is designed to be **easily customizable**, so you can adapt it to your brand, layout, or creative vision without hassle.

You don’t need to dig through complex config files — all the customization happens **directly inside the components**.

## 🧩 Tailwind CSS Customization

All UI elements are styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). This means you can:

- Change **colors**, **spacing**, **borders**, **shadows**, and **typography**
- Apply responsive variants and hover effects
- Extend or override styles with your own Tailwind configuration

Every component includes inline class names that you can edit freely. For example:

```jsx
<div className="bg-neutral-900 p-4 rounded-2xl shadow-lg">

```

Just replace the classes or add your own to match your design.

If you're using a custom `tailwind.config.js`, you can also define your own color palette, spacing scale, and more.

## 🌐 Three.js Parameter Customization

For components that use [Three.js](https://threejs.org), you’ll find clear comments and sections inside the code where you can tweak things like:

- **Colors of particles or objects**
- **Animation speed and easing**
- **Lighting, shadows, and camera position**
- **Geometry size and material type**

Each Three.js component is written to be self-contained and annotated, so you’ll see code like:

```js
const color = new THREE.Color('#dfe9e8');
const speed = 0.015;
mesh.material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color });
```

You can change these values directly to adjust the behavior and appearance of the scene.

## 🔧 How to Know What to Edit

At the top of each component file, you’ll find comments like:

```jsx
// 🔧 Customize Tailwind styles below
// 🎨 Adjust Three.js settings here
```

These markers help you quickly locate the parts of the code meant for customization — no need to read the whole file line by line.
