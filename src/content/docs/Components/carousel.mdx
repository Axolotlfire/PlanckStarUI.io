import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import CarouselOne from "../../../components/components/carousels/Carousel1.astro";
import CarouselTwo from "../../../components/components/carousels/Carousel2.astro";

The carousel components come with their own built-in script,
so make sure there are no class or variable conflicts with other components.
If you are only using components from this library, you shouldn’t encounter any issues.

To implement it, import the Carousel component into your Astro page or component,
and wrap it in a div with your desired dimensions; the carousel size will depend
on that container. Finally, edit the images and paths directly inside the Carousel component.

```jsx
<!-- src/components/Projects.astro -->

---
// Import
import Carousel from "../components/Carousel.astro";
---
(...)
<div class="Type your container dimensions here">
  <Carousel />
</div>
(...)

```

## 1. Automatic carousel

Adjust the time interval and image paths so the carousel runs automatically without requiring any user interaction.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Preview">
    <CarouselOne />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
     ```jsx
      <!-- src/components/Carousel.astro -->
              ---
       
      ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Carousel with buttons

Add navigation controls so the user can manually move forward or backward between
slides. Adjust the image paths and customize the button styles to match your project’s design.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Preview">
    <CarouselTwo />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
     ```jsx
      <!-- src/components/HeaderMinimal.astro -->
              ---
       
      ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
